Description
This is a single-page application built with React that serves as my personal portfolio website. It includes an about me section, a portfolio section that showcases my projects, a skills section that highlights my technical skills, and a contact section where visitors can get in touch with me.

The website uses a custom design based on the ts-particles library, and it includes a pagination feature to help visitors navigate the project section. The EmailJS library is used to enable the contact form to send emails, and Toastify is used to show notifications for successful email submissions.

The website is fully responsive and designed to look great on all devices. It's also optimized for fast loading times and accessibility.
